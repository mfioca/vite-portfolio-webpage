This card represents upheaval, chaos, and those moments when the universe decided to put your life in a blender without asking. This is your past, so it perfectly reflects your job loss—a major shakeup that turned your world upside down. But hey, every fairy tale needs its villains to make the hero shine even brighter, right? So, you’ve been through a storm, but that’s behind you now.\nSecond card: **The Magician**\nHere's the exciting part—the present card, The Magician. This guy is all about potential, creativity, and making things happen with a wave of his wand. Or in your case, utilizing your critical thinking and creativity for something new. This is your green light for reinvention—time to tap into those untapped abilities and make some magic. But wait, even the best magicians need a bit of help. Might I suggest our **Success Elixir**? A blend of Ginkgo Biloba and something I like to call **Eagle Eye Elixir**, designed to sharpen your focus and unleash your inner wizard. Just a thought…\nThird card: **The Seven of Cups**\nFor your future, we have The Seven of Cups. This card is about choices—lots of them. And not all of them are great, so it’s key to stay clear-headed to pick the right paths. It’s like a fantasy RPG where you’re presented with a bunch of shiny options, but only one leads to the treasure. To help stave off that debilitating indecision, how about our **Career Clarity Capsules**? Infused with Gotu Kola for cognitive support and a sprinkle of **Wishful Thinking Herb Mix**, these can keep you laser-focused on your goals.\nSo, let’s piece together this dramatic tale. You’ve got a chaotic past signified by The Tower, a present brimming with potential thanks to The Magician, and a future full of choices shown by The Seven of Cups. Not too shabby, huh? And along the way, a little herbal assist could lead you to that fairy-tale ending you’re looking for. For memory and focus, you can grab Ginkgo Biloba for $40 or dive into the world of possibilities with Gotu Kola at $49.\nThe stage is yours, my friend. Make it a legendary show!"

Let's unravel this mess a bit more and figure out where your focus should lie.\nGiven that The Magician is your present card, your current energy is ripe for creating something extraordinary. The card urges you to tap into your potential and channel that inner creativity. It’s like you've been handed the wand and the spellbook; now you just need to cast the right spell.\n\n### Here’s What I Think:\n1. **Rediscover Your Passion**: What truly excites you? The Magician suggests that diving into something that intrigues your mind and stimulates your creativity is key. Start small with projects that ignite that spark.\n2. **Boost Your Focus**: The Seven of Cups warns of a plethora of choices and potential distractions. To avoid falling into a decision-making black hole, you need to hone your focus. That’s where the **Success Elixir** of Ginkgo Biloba and **Eagle Eye Elixir** can be your best bud—keeping your concentration sharp and your mind clear.\n3. **Explore New Paths**: You’re looking for a career that lets you utilize both creativity and critical thinking. Time to brainstorm and explore different fields, whether through networking, online courses, or even trial and error. The world is your oyster, or maybe more like a clamshell with a lot of hidden stuff in it waiting to be discovered.\n4. **Self-Care**: Don’t burn out while you’re trying to escape burnout. Your focus and energy need consistent replenishment. Besides the herbs, think about practices like meditation, exercise, and more sleep. Trust me, you’re no good to anyone, least of all yourself, if you’re running on fumes all the time.\nTo sum it up, start by honing your focus and exploring what genuinely excites you, all while practicing self-care. And if you need a little herbal help, our Ginkgo Biloba and **Career Clarity Capsules** can give you that clarity and focus you need. We’ve got Ginkgo Biloba at $40 and Gotu Kola for those who want more brainpower at $49."

Something pretty rough has been weighing on you—like a Netflix series you kept watching even though it got terrible. But hey, the worst is over (probably).\n\nThe Present: The Two of Pentacles – This card is the spiritual equivalent of juggling flaming torches while riding a unicycle. It’s about balance—or, in your case, trying to balance. You’re probably running around like a caffeinated squirrel, trying to keep all the plates spinning, but don’t worry, the universe sees your struggle… and might even laugh a little.\n\nThe Future: The Star – Ooooh, shiny! The Star is all about hope, healing, and cosmic vibes giving you a much-needed hug. It’s like the universe’s way of saying, “Hang in there, buddy. Good things are coming, pinky promise.” But don’t get too comfortable—it’s still you we’re talking about."

Round of applause, but let’s hope this doesn’t mean burnout is knocking on the door.\n\nThe Present: The Five of Wands – Oh, this one’s a delight—it’s the card of competition, conflict, and, well, workplace drama. Sounds like you might be dealing with some chaos right now. Maybe it’s clashing personalities, a pile of responsibilities being tossed around like a hot potato, or just feeling like you’re constantly fighting to get ahead. It’s messy, but it’s also temporary. Hang in there.\n\nThe Future: The King of Pentacles – Well, look at this! Mr. Moneybags himself! This card screams stability, success, and being the boss. It’s like the universe finally went, “You know what? Let’s give this person a break.” This doesn’t mean you’re automatically getting promoted or starting a billion-dollar company (sadly, there’s no lottery card in tarot), but it does hint that you’re heading toward more financial security and career control.

For example:\n\n.context-box {\n    margin: 20px 0;\n    padding: 15px;\n    background-color: #f9f9f9;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n}\n\n.context-box h2 {\n    margin: 0 0 10px;\n    font-size: 1.5rem;\n    color: #333;\n}\n\n.context-box p {\n    margin: 0;\n    font-size: 1rem;\n    color: #555;\n}\n\nThese snippets are tailored to fit into your React project seamlessly while maintaining a professional tone.

To align the tab backgrounds with this style, we can suggest a subtle modification to make the tabs blend seamlessly while ensuring contrast for readability.\n\nSuggested Tab Background:\n\nA background color like #f0f0f0 (light gray) or a gradient variation similar to linear-gradient(#f5f5f5, #ffffff) would harmonize with your current design.\n\nCSS for Tabs:\n\nHere’s the updated CSS for your tab backgrounds:\n\n```css\n.tabs {\n    background: linear-gradient(#f5f5f5, #ffffff); /* Subtle gradient for tabs */\n    border-radius: 8px; /* Smooth rounded edges */\n    padding: 10px; /* Add some spacing for aesthetics */\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); /* Soft shadow for depth */\n    border: 1px solid #ddd; /* Light border for structure */\n}\n```\n\nWhy This Works:\n\n1. **Gradient Variation**:\n   - #f5f5f5 (lighter gray) adds a subtle visual distinction while staying consistent with the main gradient.\n\n2. **Rounded Edges**:\n   - Adds a polished, modern feel to the tabs.\n\n3. **Soft Shadow and Border**:\n   - These create depth and help the tabs stand out without looking overly bold.\n\nLet me know if you’d like further tweaks or additional ideas! 😊"
