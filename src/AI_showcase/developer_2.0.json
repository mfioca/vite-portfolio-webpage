Are there any errors in the browser console or network tab?\nLet me know these details so we can proceed to the next step."

Let's troubleshoot the problem systematically:\nStep 1: Gather Information\nIs your repository configured for GitHub Pages?\nEnsure you have enabled GitHub Pages in your repository settings.\nVerify the branch or directory (main, gh-pages, /docs, etc.) is correctly configured as the source for GitHub Pages.\nWhat does your GitHub Actions workflow file look like?\nCheck the .github/workflows/<your-workflow>.yml file. Look for the actions/deploy-pages step and ensure it is correctly configured.\nIs your GitHub Pages feature supported?\nVerify that you are deploying to a repository type that supports GitHub Pages (e.g., public repositories for free-tier users, private repositories on certain plans).\nDid you provide the correct permissions for the GitHub Actions token?\nEnsure the GITHUB_TOKEN has the necessary permissions to deploy to GitHub Pages.\nLet me know your findings, or share details about the workflow file and GitHub Pages settings so we can address the issue step-by-step."

Hereâ€™s the approach:\n\n1. Wrap the image and text in a shared container (`div`) to control their layout.\n2. Use `display: flex` to align them in a row. When the screen width shrinks, adjust the `order` property to move the image below the text.\n3. Use media queries for small screens to control the wrapping behavior."
