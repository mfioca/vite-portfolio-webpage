                    Inspired by my brother’s support in learning AI prompt engineering, I decided to build upon one of his examples: a Tarot Reader. This prompt features a sarcastic, burnt-out reader who works in a whimsical herbal remedy shop. What sets this character apart is their unique approach to delivering readings—they blend sharp, irreverent humor with a playful, child-like fairy-tale storytelling style.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result is a reading that’s as entertaining as it is insightful, with the reader crafting whimsical tales for each card drawn, all while maintaining their jaded, no-nonsense attitude. This project pushed my skills in blending storytelling, humor, and interactive design, proving that even a disenchanted oracle can create a truly magical experience.
